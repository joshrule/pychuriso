Experiment One
1-example, 3 objects per example

Each subject sees one of the following conditions:

CONDITION 1: a a -> a
CONDITION 2: a a -> b
CONDITION 3: a b -> a
CONDITION 4: a b -> b
CONDITION 5: a b -> c

Test questions include all combinations of n +1 objects seen.
Subjects can choose from n + 1 objects seen.

a a→?
a b→?
a c→?
b b→?
b a→?
b c→?
c a→?
c b→?

We are studying the ability to reason about abstract (pure) relational structures.
We are hoping to infer the priors on different combinators.

The Model

We can get the predictions from Churiso
